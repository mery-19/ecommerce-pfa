# Ecommerce-pfa (Projet de fin d'ann√©e, End-of-year project)
this project is realised as a part of second year of Computer Engineering class as an end-of-year technical project.
The overall objective of this project is the establishment of an E-commerce application (web and mobile) with high performance technologies, the project is dedicated to small businesses selling computer or electronic equipments.
To do this, we have chosen to work with the **ASP.MVC** Framework as the main technology for the web application, **Flutter** for the mobile version ([See the android version](https://github.com/mery-19/pfaMobile)), as well as **UML** for modeling.
Our application allows small businesses to have a simple and flexible space to use and manage material and human resources. It also contains a customer interface (customer
account), where he can consult his latest activities, and track the status of his purchases.
For payment transactions, we have integrated the **Paypal API**, which provides secure transactions.
